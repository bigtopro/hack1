## 2. Key Emotional Drivers

### Reasons for Desire
**Reasons Behind Desire: Expectation vs Outcome**

Viewers feel a strong desire to participate in MrBeast's challenges due to a mismatch between their expectations and the outcome. Many commenters express a sense of entitlement, expecting to be invited or selected for a challenge without putting in any effort. This is evident in comments like "I need your help please invite me" and "Please next challenge me invite please please please." They feel that their desire to participate should be enough to secure a spot.

**Reasons Behind Desire: Effort vs Reward**

On the other hand, some viewers feel a strong desire to participate because they believe it will bring them a significant reward, often financial. Comments like "I need $100,000, please. I don't want anything else" and "Sir, I also want to participate in the challenge video and I am very poor, I want to become rich" suggest that viewers see MrBeast's challenges as a way to achieve financial stability or success. They are willing to put in effort to participate, but only if it leads to a substantial reward.

**Reasons Behind Desire: Inclusion vs Exclusion**

Another reason for the desire to participate is a sense of exclusion. Viewers feel left out of the challenges and want to be included. Comments like "I want to be in your next challenge please" and "I want to appear in one of your videos, MrBeast" convey a sense of longing to be part of the experience. They feel that being excluded from the challenges is unfair and want to be given a chance to participate.

**Emotional Engagement and Memorability**

The desire to participate in MrBeast's challenges is a strong emotional driver, indicating high engagement and memorability. Viewers are invested in the idea of participating and are willing to express their desire repeatedly. However, the lack of clarity around the selection process and the perceived unfairness of the system may lead to frustration and disappointment.

**Passive vs Active Viewing**

The comments suggest that viewers are primarily in a passive viewing mode, reacting to the challenges and wanting to be included. However, some comments like "Come on mrbeast now we need a new concept" indicate that viewers are also in

### Unmet Expectations

Viewers express disgust due to a perceived mismatch between their expectations and the outcome. They feel that the winner was undeserving, implying that the competition was unfair or that the winner did not put in enough effort. This is evident in comments like "The worst winner" and "Literally the worst guy won." These viewers expected a more deserving winner, and the actual outcome fell short of their expectations.

### Poor Content Quality

Another reason for disgust is the poor quality of the content. Viewers express frustration with the ending, final outcome, or overall content of the video. Comments like "The worst ending" and "Content is going worse and worse" suggest that the viewers were disappointed with the way the video unfolded. This disgust is not necessarily tied to the winner but rather to the quality of the content itself.

How disgusting) suggest that the winner's actions or behavior were deemed unacceptable.

Finally, some viewers express disgust due to a perceived injustice in the competition. Comments like "Worst contestant in the history of Mr. Beast" and "Worst Mr. beast winner of all time" suggest that the viewers felt the winner was not only undeserving but also that the competition was rigged or unfair.

This is evident in comments like "The least deserving one won it… god dammit" and "The guy who won is the least deserving of the last 3". They feel that the winner did not deserve the prize, possibly due to their behavior or performance.

**Reason 2: Disrespect and Rudeness**

Some viewers are annoyed by the winner's behavior, which they perceive as rude and disrespectful. Comments like "He was so rude and disrespectful. How's it feel to win the way you didn't want to win?" and "A real man want's to compete and not have shi handed to him" suggest that the winner's actions were seen as unacceptable.

**Reason 3: Lack of Skill or Effort**

A few viewers are annoyed because they feel the winner did not put in enough effort or skill to win. Comments like "I wouldn't have taken my hand off for the guy who won😂 He was so rude and disrespectful" and "Competing with ur skill, moral and intellect for over 18 hours hust to hace luck decide the winner is shitty as heck" suggest that the winner's win was seen as undeserved.

**Reasons for Approval**

There are multiple reasons why viewers feel approval in response to the video. The main reasons can be categorized into the following:

### **Respect for the Winner's Strategy**

Viewers approve of the winner's approach, which involved playing strategically and not relying on luck. This is evident in comments such as "He could have won mind games and he has win the luck game as well" and "Totally deserved it, 2vs1 also gave them many diferent options so it wasn’t based off luck and still won, he played with strategy." These viewers appreciate the winner's ability to adapt and make the most of the situation.

### **Disapproval of Luck-Based Approach**

Another reason for approval is the viewers' disapproval of the luck-based approach taken by the other players. Comments such as "leaving it up to luck was stupid" and "the fact that they were wanting to base it off luck instead of skill is trash" reflect this sentiment. These viewers believe that skill and strategy should be the primary factors in determining the outcome, rather than luck.

### **Fate and Destiny**

Some viewers express approval due to a sense of fate or destiny being at play. Comments such as "in the end, only that happens which is written in your destiny" and "it was fate, so we have to accept it" suggest that the outcome was predetermined and therefore inevitable. These viewers seem to be accepting of the winner's success as a matter of fate rather than skill or strategy.

### **Personal Connection and Empathy**

Finally, some viewers express approval due to a personal connection or empathy with the winner. Comments such as "finally someone who i wanted to win, won" and "i fw the winner overly" suggest that these viewers have a personal stake in the winner's success. This emotional connection may be driving their approval of the winner's outcome.

**Implications**

The prevalence of neutral reactions and the diversity of reasons for approval suggest that the video may not be particularly memorable or emotionally engaging for all viewers. However, the fact that viewers are actively commenting and expressing their opinions suggests that the video is sparking some level of engagement and discussion. The variety of reasons for approval also suggests that the

### Reasons for Neutral
**Emotional Engagement: Neutral Reactions**

The two groups of viewers exhibit distinct emotional engagement patterns. One group with 2590 comments displays consistent neutral reactions, while the other group with 4719 comments shows mixed emotions.

**Reasons for Neutral Reactions**

The consistent neutral reactions in the first group can be attributed to:

* **Lack of emotional investment**: Viewers may not have been invested in the outcome or the content, leading to a neutral response.
* **Clarity vs Confusion**: The content may have been clear and straightforward, but not engaging or memorable enough to elicit a strong emotional response.
* **Effort vs Reward**: Viewers may have felt that the effort required to engage with the content did not match the perceived reward or value.

In contrast, the mixed emotions in the second group suggest that viewers are more actively engaged with the content, but their emotions are influenced by various factors, such as:

* **Expectation vs Outcome**: Viewers may have had high expectations that were not met, leading to disappointment or frustration.
* **Inclusion vs Exclusion**: Viewers may feel included or excluded from the content or the community surrounding it, influencing their emotional response.
* **Fairness vs Luck**: Viewers may perceive the content or the outcome as unfair or based on luck, leading to negative emotions.

**Memorability and Passive vs Active Viewing**

The consistent neutral reactions in the first group suggest that the content may not be memorable or engaging enough to leave a lasting impression. This may indicate passive viewing, where viewers are not actively invested in the content.

In contrast, the mixed emotions in the second group suggest that viewers are more actively engaged with the content, but their emotions are influenced by various factors. This may indicate a more dynamic and interactive viewing experience.

**Why Neutral Reactions Matter**

Neutral reactions can be a sign of a lack of emotional investment or engagement, which can negatively impact viewer retention and loyalty.

### Reasons for Amusement
**Emotional Engagement**

The comments suggest a mix of emotions, including amusement, satisfaction, and frustration. However, the tone is generally lighthearted and playful, with many users expressing laughter and excitement. This implies that the content is engaging and entertaining, but not necessarily emotionally resonant or thought-provoking.

**Memorability**

The presence of neutral reactions (e.g., "Cool vid") and comments asking for clarification or additional information (e.g., "You Should get Teenagers to Compete in a challenge thatll be pretty funny") suggests that the content is memorable, but not necessarily impactful or memorable in a deep way. Users are recalling specific moments or aspects of the video, but not necessarily reflecting on the content's themes or messages.

**Passive vs Active Viewing**

The comments imply a mix of passive and active viewing. Some users are simply reacting to the content without engaging with it critically (e.g., "Lol 😂"), while others are actively interpreting and analyzing the content (e.g., "That guy surely deserved it. Bro tried to win it by skill but other 2 wanted luck and boom they were unlucky hahaha it's so satisfying"). This suggests that the content is engaging enough to prompt both passive and active engagement, but not necessarily encouraging critical thinking or reflection.

**Differences in Emotional Engagement**

There are two distinct reasons behind the emotional engagement:

1. **Amusement and satisfaction**: Many users are laughing and expressing satisfaction at the outcome of the challenge. This is likely due to the unexpected twist and the perceived "justice" of the winner.
2. **Frustration and disappointment**: Some users are expressing frustration and disappointment at the winner's decision to rely on luck rather than skill. This is likely due to a sense of unfairness and a perceived lack of integrity on the part of the winner.

These two reasons are distinct and reflect different emotional responses to the content.

### Reasons for Admiration
**Reasons for Admiration**

### Appreciation for Quality

Viewers express admiration for the video's quality, using words like "good," "awesome," and "wonderful." This suggests that the video meets or exceeds their expectations, providing a positive outcome.

### Respect for Individuals

Another group of viewers expresses admiration for specific individuals, such as pilots, using words like "respect," "massive respect," and "huge respect." This implies that the viewers value the effort or achievement of these individuals, perceiving them as deserving of admiration.

### Surprise and Delight

A third group of viewers expresses admiration using words like "well well well" and enthusiastic language (e.g., "😮 que bien"). This suggests that the video's outcome exceeded their expectations, providing a pleasant surprise. The use of exclamation marks and enthusiastic language emphasizes the strength of their admiration.

### Comparison of Reasons

The reasons for admiration differ in their focus: some viewers appreciate the video's quality, while others value the effort or achievement of specific individuals. The surprise and delight group, on the other hand, is driven by a positive outcome that exceeded their expectations. These differences in focus reflect distinct underlying reasons for admiration.

### Implications for Viewer Engagement

The prevalence of neutral reactions and admiration comments implies that viewers are actively engaged with the content, but may not be deeply invested in the narrative or emotional arc. The admiration comments suggest that viewers are motivated by a desire to appreciate quality, recognize effort, or experience surprise and delight. This matters for viewer engagement because it highlights the importance of delivering a high-quality product that meets or exceeds expectations, as well as recognizing and valuing the efforts of individuals involved in the content.
